# Chess
A fully playable Java Chess Game


This is a project that I've been working on off and on in my spare time for awhile, finally at a "completed" state.

Some noteworthy features are the use of the Swing powered GUI that makes the game relatively visually appealing and the Minimax algorithm that makes the computer too hard for me to beat even when set at the medium difficulty. 

To run the program, simply downloard and run the executable, from there the GUI makes things intuitive.

The only bugs that I'm aware of at this time is that En Passant moves cannot be performed with Pawns and when having two AI play against each other they will typically end up repeating the same moves due to the purely mathematical decision making.
